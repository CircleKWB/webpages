    <p>Hello! My name is Jessica Garrett, soon to be Jessica Stroud, and I'm a freshman here at <strong>North Carolina
    State University</strong>. I intend to major in <em>Nuclear Engineering</em> and minor in Spanish. I feel that 
    renewable energy is very important moving forward as a society, not just for our environment, but also 
    economically. I'm minoring in Spanish just because I like the language. </p>    

    </br>
        
    <p style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 15px; color: #284d3d; text-align: center;">
    In terms of a job I've had that's furthering my career goals, I intern at <ins>Stroud Engineering</ins> in Morehead City,
     NC. They handle coastal projects with mechanical/electrical engineering. I really like working with them but I 
    feel better fulfilled knowing I will be working with renewable energy in the future.</p>
